                        <div><h2 style="padding-top: .5em;" id="title">The Purpose of Premiums</h2></div>
                        <div><p>Options are priced based off of the stasticial likelihood that the contract will
                            expire in the money, or at a price where the contract can be executed. A stock is fairly random.
                            It's price deviates on a standard distribution, with a long term compounding trend upwards.
                        </p></div>
                        <div><p>Thus, the more volatile a stock, the more likely the stock price will deviate so that
                            a contract will expire in the money. Thus, the premium is higher. The higher the likelihood the
                            contract can expire ITM, there more the premium. This is very important, because premiums change as
                            you hold them.
                        </p></div>
                        <div><p>If you buy an options contract and the share price rises to being near or above the strike price,
                            the premium will rise. Therefore, you don't even need to exercise the right to buy. You can simply sell
                            the increased risk of exercision in the form of an increased premium. Options are always priced in.
                            You will never see an option which instantly grants you money, because then someone would be losing money.
                            Thus, an option will always be unprofitable at first until the share price changes thanks to the change
                            in the premium of the contract.
                        </p></div>
                        <div><p>This also means the futher the expiration date, the more change can occur in share price. Thus, the premiums
                            for longer-term contracts are much higher. Contracts far out of the money expiring next week, however, are
                            not likely to be exercised and thus their premiums are low. However, if a stock jumps sharply in the time frame,
                            you can benefit. You buy an inexpensive premium and benefit greatly from exercising the contract far
                            from market price. You pocket the difference with premiums too, and make a lot of money.
