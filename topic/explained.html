                        <div><p>There are two important things about options. One, they give you the ability to buy/sell
                            at a set price (called the strike price). Two, they have what are called premiums to offset
                            the cost of writing that option. Why are these two facts so important. Let me explain
                        </p></div>
                        <div><p>Let's say Investor A wants to buy Apple at $10/share, and it currently trades at $9. Well,
                            instead buying at $9 and hoping it goes to $10, Investor A could buy the option to buy at $10.
                            This sounds a bit redundant. Why would you want this instead of owning the stock? Well, it's quite simple.
                            Investor A could buy that contract to buy Apple at $10 for a premium. If Apple were to crash to $0 tomorrow,
                            then he only loses the premium he paid. Risk averted.
                        </p></div>
                        <div><p>More importantly, is that options make it possible for Investor A to buy a share differing from its market
                            price. It's better than merely owning the share from the get-go too. Why? Because options come in bundles of 100. 
                            If you buy an option to purchase $10 Apple shares with a 10 cent premium/share and the stock rises to $15, you
                            pocket $15-10.10 times 100. That is $490 from a $10 up front total premium charge.
                        </p></div>
                        <div><p>Options are a zero-sum game. When you make money, the man who wrote the contract loses money. That's
                            why a premium exists. The writer is betting on the strike price not being reached or the contract not executed.
                        </s></p></div>
